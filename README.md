Designed a RGB color guessing game with easy and hard levels. There is also an option to choose new colors or a new game. In this game an RGB color would be given and there are 6 colors displayed among which we have to choose the correct color. If a wrong color is chosen then that color would disappear from the display and we will be left with only the rest of the colors from which we have to choose the right one! 
As it is an RGB game the colors would range from 0-255.
